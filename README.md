# Overview

Over the past few years, I have collected 300k+ e-Microscope images for the purpose of developing an experimental clinic test AI platform that can be applied more easily and cheaply.
These include erythrocyte, leukocyte, platelet and sperm burns from peripheral blood and frontal fluids specimens.
Dozens of clinical test experts have fully labeled this dataset for object detection and classification.
This is the world's largest e-Microscope image dataset for clinical body fluids test.
I would like to know if someone is willing to exclusively purchase my Micell dataset.
If I can't find a buyer, I'm going to open this dataset together with the report to the world.
Prior to this, I'm going to train object counting and classifying models(Yolo-like) on Micell.
Trained models will be published along with the report and dataset.
